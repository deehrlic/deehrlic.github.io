excerpt: 'In this demo, we present a novel technique for defining topologically optimal scaffoldings for 3D printed objects using a Monte Carlo algorithm based on the foraging behavior of the Physarum polycephalum slime mold. As a case study, we have created a biologically inspired bicycle helmet using this technique that is designed to be effective in resisting impacts. We have created a prototype of this helmet and propose further studies that measure the effectiveness and validity of the design.'

In this demo, we present a novel technique for defining topologically optimal scaffoldings for 3D printed objects using a Monte Carlo algorithm based on the foraging behavior of the Physarum polycephalum slime mold. As a case study, we have created a biologically inspired bicycle helmet using this technique that is designed to be effective in resisting impacts. We have created a prototype of this helmet and propose further studies that measure the effectiveness and validity of the design.
