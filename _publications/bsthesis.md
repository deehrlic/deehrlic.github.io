title: "Printing the Polyphorm: Using 3D Printing to Manufacture Biologically Inspired Rhizomatic Structures"
collection: publications
citation: Drew Ehrlich
permalink: /publication/bsthesis
excerpt: 'We present a pipeline for converting voxelized data generated by the Monte Carlo Physarum Machine (MCPM) based Polyphorm data visualization software into a mesh that can then be 3D printed. This reconstruction technique is based on the Marching Cubes algorithm paired with a suite of pre and post processing tools. Our process can be used to create both biomimetic structures and computational art, and can be tuned to create various visual effects based on the desired stylistic output.'
