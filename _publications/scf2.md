excerpt: 'In this demo, we present an open source methodology for turning triangle meshes into biologically inspired 3D printable objects using an algorithm based on the behavior of the Physarum polycephalum slime mold. Users can import watertight 3D models and have full control of the simulation, allowing for granular control over the density and weight of the resulting network. This is the first open source tool to use this technique that is intended for public consumption and use.'
